# BattlecatsInc
BattlecatsInc is a group project for CIS 2910 IT Capstone.
It is a fictitious company website that sells computer components. 
It uses HTML,CSS,JavaScript,PHP,and integrates an SQL database and Azure cloud deployment.
I set up the database Microsoft's SSMS and migrated it to Azure.
The "Product Information" pages for each product were produced thru php pages that returned the data from the db.
The product pages were produced thru a combination of HTML, css, javascript, and .json files.
The "Cart" and "Pay Authorization" pages were built from templets obtained online.
