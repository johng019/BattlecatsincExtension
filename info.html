                    BattleCats is an organization founded in 2020 built upon providing the highest quality service and parts at reasonable price by a small group of individuals at Valencia College in Orlando, Florida. 
                The college team that founded it had seen a gap in the computer parts market that needed to be filled.  With so many options available for the average consumer as well as the seasoned pro, there needed
                to be a place where anyone could get access to what they needed quickly and without headache.</p>  
                
                <p>  
                    From these principles, BattleCats Inc. was created, and their platform solidified with giving a simple and
                crisp experience to all consumers in the computer market. These founders continue to work diligently even after their company grew to the e-commerce giant that it is today. As our world continues to evolve,
                so will we.  We want to continue to meet our consumers ever changing expectations and give the highest quality experience we can.  This is why we hire and cultivate talented individuals with a passion with 
                computers and customer service to be able to help our consumers with any of their needs.  From repairs to simple questions, our certified staff is more than happy to help at every turn.

                    Our greatest achievement is being able to give back to the people by donating computers and parts to schools and small businesses. By doing so, we’re able to provide for future generations to grow and learn
                how to work with parts and computers to further their careers in the IT field.  We might strive for the best prices and parts first, but what truly comes first is taking care of the next generation of builders
                and engineers. With knowledge in the technological field, the possibilities are endless. In the future we hope to pathe a path of success so that anybody can shape their own future into being a bright one.
